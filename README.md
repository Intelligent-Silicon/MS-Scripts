# MS-Scripts & Utilities.
 Links to useful MS Scripts and Utility apps for configuring Windows PC's
 
 
 ### Dev Box setup
 
 A link to Microsoft's Github account with a script for setting up a standard Dev Box aka a Developer's PC.
 The script removes apps which are not usually needed in the course of writing software. 
 Useful for configuring virtual PC's that are used for automated testing purposes.

 ### VenToy
 
"Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files.
With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files to the USB drive and boot them directly.
You can copy many files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them."

 ### AutoUnattend
 
 A website to create and configure an AutoUnattend.xml which is searched for and used to automatically install Windows. This can prevent installation of software which can be removed using the MS Dev Box scripts. Your own scripts can be added to the AutoUnattend.xml file to further configure the Windows box during and immediately after installation. This is useful for those who spend a bit of time, adjusting windows to suit their individual preferences and way of working, including additional programs which support command line installations.

 Additional utilities will be added over time if I find them useful for myself.
